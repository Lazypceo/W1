<h2><u>Let it go_<a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EA%B2%A8%EC%9A%B8%EC%99%95%EA%B5%AD" target="_blank" title="겨울왕국">겨울왕국 ost</a></u></h2>
<p>The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
<br>Not a footprint to be seen
<br>A kingdom of isolation
<br>And it looks like I'm the queen
<br>The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
<br>Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
<br>Don't let them in, don't let them see
<br>Be the good girl you always have to be
<br>Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
<br>Well, now they know
<br><strong>Let it go, let it go</strong>
<br>Can't hold it back anymore
<br>Let it go, let it go
<br>Turn away and slam the door
<br>I don't care what they're going to say
<br>Let the storm rage on
<br>The cold never bothered me anyway
<br>It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
<br>And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
<br>It's time to see what I can do
<br>To test the limits and break through
<br>No right, no wrong, no rules for me
<br>I'm free
<br><strong>Let it go, let it go</strong>
<br>I am one with the wind and sky
<br><strong>Let it go, let it go</strong>
<br>You'll never see me cry
<br>Here I stand and here I stay
<br>Let the storm rage on
<br>My power flurries through the air into the ground
<br>My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
<br>And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
<br>I'm never going back, the past is in the past
<br><strong>Let it go, let it go</strong>
<br>When I'll rise like the break of dawn
<br><strong>Let it go, let it go</strong>
<br>That perfect girl is gone
<br>Here I stand in the light of day
<br>Let the storm rage on
<br>The cold never bothered me anyway</p>
